### Benchmarking
* [The Art of Benchmarking](http://mattwarren.org/2014/09/19/the-art-of-benchmarking/) by Matt Warren

### Monitoring

### Investigations
* [Как я провёл две недели в поисках утечки памяти](http://be9.ru/2015/09/12/memory-leak.html) by Олег Дашевский. "Это история о поисках утечки памяти. Она довольно длинная, потому что я привожу массу подробностей. Почему я решил описать свои приключения? Дело не только в практическом стремлении сохранить все мелкие скрипты и куски кода. Мне на минуточку показалось, что это и есть UNIX way – то, что меня вело. Каждый шаг был связан с очередной небольшой утилитой или библиотекой, которая хорошо решает свою задачу. И я в итоге достиг успеха." 🇷🇺
* [How I spent two weeks hunting a memory leak in Ruby](http://www.be9.io/2015/09/21/memory-leak/) by Oleg Dashevskii. "This is a story about hunting a memory leak. A long story, because I go into much detail. Why describe my adventures? Not that I wanted to save all those tiny code pieces and scripts only. It rather occurred to me that it was UNIX way which I had pursued. Every step was related to yet another small utility, or a library, which solves its task well. And finally I succeeded." 🇺🇸

### JIT Optimizations

### Threading

### Memory
* [Debugging hidden memory leaks in Ruby](https://samsaffron.com/archive/2019/10/08/debugging-unmanaged-and-hidden-memory-leaks-in-ruby) - "This article covers tools and tricks you can use to attack leaks that you can not easily introspect in Ruby. In particular I will discuss mwrap, heaptrack, iseq_collector and chap." by Sam Saffron (2019-10-15) 🇺🇸
* [What causes Ruby memory to bloat](https://www.joyfulbikeshedding.com/blog/2019-03-14-what-causes-ruby-memory-bloat.html) - How memory allocation works in Ruby and how to improve it with malloc_trim API. 🇺🇸
* [The Definitive Guide to Ruby Heap Dumps, Part I](https://blog.codeship.com/the-definitive-guide-to-ruby-heap-dumps-part-i/) - “When you can’t reproduce memory bloat, here’s how to work with a heap dump.” by Richard Schneeman (Last updated: 2017-06-19) 🇺🇸
* [The Definitive Guide to Ruby Heap Dumps, Part II](https://blog.codeship.com/the-definitive-guide-to-ruby-heap-dumps-part-ii/)- “When you can’t reproduce memory bloat, here’s how to work with a heap dump.” by Richard Schneeman (Last updated: 2017-06-19) 🇺🇸

### Memory Improvements
* 2019
  * [Introduce malloc_trim(0) in full gc cycles](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15667) - Per Hongli's excellent article it looks like malloc_trim can help tremendously with memory bloat issues. 🇺🇸
* 2018
  * [set M_ARENA_MAX for glibc malloc](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14759) - Not everybody benefits from jemalloc and the extra download+install time is not always worth it. Lets make the user experience for glibc malloc users better, too. 🇺🇸
  * [Use jemalloc by default?](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14718) 🇺🇸
